# AI Coding Tools

AI coding tools are a type of software that allows developers to write code faster and more efficiently.

## Cursor

Cursor is a VSCode fork that allows you to write code with AI. This is an AI native IDE.

## Windsurf

Like Cursor, Windsurf is a VSCode fork, an AI native IDE.

## GitHub Copilot

Similar to Cursor and Windsurf, but as an IDE extension instead of a fork. All of Cursor, Windsurf and GitHub Copilot have agent capabilities.

## Google Jules

- Google Jules is an autonomous cloud native AI coding agent that can create PRs in your GitHub repositories based on features you request through natural language.

## OpenAI's Codex

Like Google Jules, OpenAI's Codex is an autonomous cloud native AI coding agent that can write code. It's built on the codex-1 model that is a flavor of the o3 optimized for coding, trained using reinforcement learning.

## Claude Code

Claude Code is a terminal based AI coding agent that can write code. It can be viewed as a primitive for tooling like semantic linting, code review, etc.
